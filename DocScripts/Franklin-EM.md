**Because the surface charge distribution on conductors cannot be specified until the electric field is known**, we need an new approach for electrostatics. 

From experiment we can find that a new force, *electric force*, is propotional to a quantity called the *electric charge* $q$ for the object. This defines a vector field called the *electric field*, which is:
$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf F = q\mathbf E .
\end{equation}
$$
Basic equations: 
$$
\begin{gather}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf E = 4\pi \rho , \\
\nabla \times \mathbf E = 0 . 
\end{gather}
$$

### 3.1.1

Let $\mathbf{E_1}$ and $\mathbf{E_2}$ be two different solutions to the basic equation. 

Let
$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\mathcal{E}} = \mathbf{E_1} - \mathbf{E_2},
\end{equation}
$$
and 
$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\mathcal{E}} = - \nabla \psi .
\end{equation}
$$
After calculation, we will have
$$
\begin{equation}
\int_V|\mathbf{\mathcal{E}}|^2d\tau = -\oint_S \psi\mathbf{\mathcal{E}}\cdot d\mathbf A . 
\end{equation}
$$
We need the surface integral vanish to make $\mathbf{\mathcal{E}} = 0$. 

1. No conductors  
   The surface $S$ can be taken as a large sphere approaching infinite radius.  
   **Boundary condition**: possible electric fields all have the same asymptotic behavior (at least to order $1/R^2$).
2. With conductors  
     
   **exterior problem** and **interior problem**
